# KNN-algorithm
In this assignment, I create a neural network in Python Language with hand coded backpropagation algorithm.

Neural network use ReLU activation in hidden layers and Softmax in the output layer. 
Neural network can have arbitrary number of layers and each layer could have arbitrary number of neurons. 
Using MNIST dataset
